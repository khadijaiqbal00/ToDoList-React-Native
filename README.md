# ToDoList-React-Native
Users can add tasks to the list, update, and delete tasks from the list. To display the list of tasks, I used a FlatList component from the React Native library. The FlatList component will render each task as a separate item in the list.
- To add a new task to the list, user have to enter the task title and press Add Item button

- Clicking on delete icon will delete that item from the list
- To Update an Item, click on it enter the new title and press Update Item Button
